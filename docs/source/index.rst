OpenFHE-rs is a Rust interface for the OpenFHE library, which is renowned for its comprehensive suite of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) schemes, all implemented in C++. By providing a Rust wrapper for OpenFHE, we aim to make these advanced FHE capabilities easily accessible to Rust developers.

Whether you're developing secure data processing applications or privacy-focused tools, OpenFHE-rs enables you to leverage the powerful encryption technologies of OpenFHE seamlessly within your Rust projects.
