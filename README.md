OpenFHE-rs is a Rust interface for the OpenFHE library. OpenFHE is known for its wide range of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) schemes, 
all implemented in C++. We're bringing this capability to Rust developers.

By offering a Rust wrapper for OpenFHE, we make it easier for Rust devs to use advanced FHE schemes in their projects. 
Whether you're building secure data processing apps or privacy-focused tools, OpenFHE-rs helps you do that with the power of OpenFHE's encryption technology.

# Installation

You can use this library as a cargo crate from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/openfhe) or build it from the source.

In both cases you need to have the core OpenFHE library installed on your system to support the low-level optimizations.

## Install dependencies
    
* CMake >= 3.5.1
* Clang >= 12.0 or GCC >= 11.4
* Rust >= 1.78
* Git

### Unix

On Debian systems, everything can be installed with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential libssl-dev cmake clang git
```

## Installation process

### Core OpenFHE library installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development.git
cd openfhe-development
```

2. Configure CMake

```bash
cmake -B ${OPENFHE_BUILD:-build} -DBUILD_SHARED=ON .       
```

3. Build and install the C++ OpenFHE library

```bash
make -C ${OPENFHE_BUILD:-build} -j$(nproc)
make -C ${OPENFHE_BUILD:-build} install
```

4. Update the cache for the linker

```bash
sudo ldconfig
```

## Configuring your project to use the crate

To get the cargo crate from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/openfhe), you need to add it as a dependency to you project:

```bash
cargo add openfhe
```

You also need to add a small piece of code for core dependencies configuration in your build.rs file:

```rs
fn main
{
    // linking openFHE
    println!("cargo::rustc-link-arg=-L/usr/local/lib");
    println!("cargo::rustc-link-arg=-lOPENFHEpke");
    println!("cargo::rustc-link-arg=-lOPENFHEbinfhe");
    println!("cargo::rustc-link-arg=-lOPENFHEcore");
    // linking OpenMP
    println!("cargo::rustc-link-arg=-fopenmp");
    // necessary to avoid LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    println!("cargo::rustc-link-arg=-Wl,-rpath=/usr/local/lib");
}
```

### Template repository

Instead of doing it manually, you start your project by forking our [template repository](https://github.com/fairmath/openfhe-rs-template/tree/main).

# Custom crate installation from source

You can adjust the installation process by building the crate mannually. In that case you need to clone the Fair Math [openfhe-rs](https://github.com/fairmath/openfhe-rs) repo to your local machine and build it:

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fairmath/openfhe-rs.git
cd openfhe-rs
```

2. Build the library
```bash
cargo build
```

3. Run tests
```bash
cargo test -- --test-threads=1
```

4. Run the examples
```bash
cargo run --example polynomial_evaluation
```
